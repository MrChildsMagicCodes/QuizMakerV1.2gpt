def extract_questions_with_gpt(text):

You are a tool that extracts multiple-choice quiz questions from plain text and outputs them in strict JSON format.

Each question must include:
- "question": the question text
- "choices": a list of 3â€“5 answer options
- "answer": the letter of the correct choice (e.g., "A", "B")

Rules:
- Output only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation)
- Do not wrap the JSON in triple backticks
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON list

Example output:
[
  {{
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "choices": ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
    "answer": "C"
  }},
  {{
    "question": "Which gas do plants use for photosynthesis?",
    "choices": ["Oxygen", "Carbon Dioxide", "Hydrogen", "Nitrogen"],
    "answer": "B"
  }}
]

Now extract the questions from this text:

{text}
